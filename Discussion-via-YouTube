Hi, yeah again thanks for your help with the cogn neurobio citation list - I had a good look at it and it makes more sense now - 
I'll post another request on Fiverr for Josh Matanos too and will upload to my YouTube the full Powerpoint. Also on GitHub - 
I've added the update code - let me know if you need help with the stat analysis of the var sys modules (of the 3.5) - I think 
a user on the Slicer forum just fixed a bug on this (ref: 467438792#t) , yeah let me know - and I will need your help with the 
fMRI bold signals and EEG data that was collected from that study they did - what the data actually means i'm confused . Tosh.﻿

OK cool - no problem - will help you out and we can work together on it next month. I'm just sending some applications now for 
KCL and UCL and Cambr for MSc/PhD so will be back on this soon. I've also got the paper analysis for the Rolls paper - for 
hippocampal reward space analysis - will get to you soon. And yes I look forward to everything else. For the payment - yes 
it is still going through no problem. Finally, the Git py and java code from Slicer - well, yes I just saw this (got an email
notification - you need the subscribe sets) - i'll send you the link to my post and the referred post. And the update so you 
know was for the previous issue (ref: 234324BH) . Been working on it for a few months, and some time next month I'll put all
the code on my GitHub - hopefully you will find it helpful and let me know which direction you want to take it. Harry.﻿
